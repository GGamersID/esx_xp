## Requirements

* [es_extended](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

## Download & Installation

* Download and extract the package: https://github.com/Mobius1/esx_xp/archive/master.zip
* Rename the `esx_xp-master` directory to `esx_xp`
* Drop the `esx_xp` directory into your `[esx]` directory on your server
* Add `start esx_xp` in your `server.cfg`
* Edit `config.lua` to your liking
* Start your server and rejoice!

## Configuration

The `config.lua` file is set to emulate GTA:O as close as possible, but can be changed to fit your own needs.

```lua
Config.Enabled = true       -- enable / disable the resource
Config.Locale = 'en'        -- Current language
Config.Width = 532          -- Sets the width of the XP bar in px
Config.Timeout = 5000       -- Sets the interval in ms that the XP bar is shown after updating
Config.BarSegments = 10     -- Sets the number of segments the XP bar has. Native GTA:O is 10
Config.Ranks = {}          -- XP ranks. Must be a table of integers with the first element being 0.
```
